Review of paper named 'Lightweight 3D Human Pose Estimation Network Training Using Teacher-Student Learning'

This paper presenting MoVNect which is a lightweight deep neural network(DNN) with teacher-student learning 
to capture 3D human pose in mobile devices.

There are several way to lightwieghting the models. Most of the neural network such as ResNet, DenseNet, and GoogleNet have so many
layers contained itself, so it takes alot of time and calculation for each processes. This large amount of model size is not compatible to
real world.

* Neural Network Pruning 
After finish connecting parameters between nodes, some nodes are definitely less important than other major nodes. We neglect or delete
these less important connections between nodes to lightning the model. However, this process will decrease the accuracy of model.
It needs extra training after deletion of model connection to enhancement.
* Low Rank Approximation
Singular Vector Decomposition, Filter-Bank
* Quantization
Normally all the parameters are 32bit or 64bit for default. However, some of parameters are not requiring precise precision number.
16, 8, 4 bit precision still shows good performance contrast to original precision. Additionally on the parallel computing
depends on hardware performance even gets higher.
* Knowledge-Distillation
