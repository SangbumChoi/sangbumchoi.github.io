If we see some file related with dataset or other files, .json files seem very familiar with us. JSON file is an abstract of javascript
object notation. Originally it was made for easy communication of data transfer or loading in models. Bascially the base template
of json flow is looks like below image.

JSON has two basic templates which are respectively name and value. Object is unoreder set of name and value. Object start and end with {},
for each names it has to be end with : and seperation method is done by using comma. For array, it is an ordered collection of datatype.
It starts and ends with [], this type also seperate array value with ,.

There is also XML file to communicate with other datasets. This will be also held in near future in this post.
